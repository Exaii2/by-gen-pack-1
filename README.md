# by-gen-pack-1
Small selection of content (by me) for BY-GEN (by Curtis Holt, https://github.com/curtisjamesholt/BY-GEN-public). Uses BY-GENs official content pack as a basis.

![BY-GEN_Content_Pack_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18192380/225622216-7a6240eb-5fec-40f5-9892-310d2f77e5a5.png)

Adds a small selection of five additional surface effects, intended to be used with Curtis Holts BY-GEN blender plugin.
This was lying around in my personal files for some time, decided to be released now. 

The effects include:
- Bismuth: A selection of multiple simple meshes to create a stylized bismuth surface. 
- Crystallized: Overlaps simple geometric shapes to create something akin to a crystallized surface.
- RoughStone: Uses a few low-detail meshes to create rough-looking shards of stone on the surface. Results may vary in quality.
- Trypo: An abstract arching shape.
- Trypo_2: an abstract organic looking shape, perhaps to be used as alien rock.

Installation:
Place the 'Exaii_Content_Pack_1' folder inside BY-GENs 'content_packs'-folder for plugin integration. 
Use the dropdown in BY-GENs Surface Effects Tab to select this content pack to access it the way intended.

Created on the basis of Curtis Holts 'Official'-content pack file inside said plugin. 
Uses a slightly modified setup in geometry nodes, mostly similiar to Curtis' original surface effects. 

Current Issues:
- Might create a unused duplicate collection for the effect. This additional collection can be deleted safely. Debug pending.

Thanks:
- Thanks to Curtis for creating BY-GEN, and to all the additional creators involved in the project.
